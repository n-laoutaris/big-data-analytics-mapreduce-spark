# Big Data Hands-On mini-project: MapReduce & Spark

This repository showcases hands-on big data analytics using both Hadoop MapReduce (with Python MRJob) and Apache Spark (PySpark). The projects were developed as part of my MSc in Data Science Big Data coursework and demonstrate practical analytics on two real-world datasets:

- **Car Sales Transactions** ([Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedanwarafridi/vehicle-sales-data))
- **Techcrunch Blog Posts (2010)** ([Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakritidis/identifying-influential-bloggers-techcrunch))

## Contents

- `Hadoop_MapReduce_mini_project.ipynb`  
  MapReduce analytics on car sales data using Python and MRJob.
- `Spark_mini_project.ipynb`  
  Spark analytics on car sales and blog post data using both DataFrame SQL and RDD APIs.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and real-world data issues.
- **Descriptive Analytics:** Yearly and brand-based statistics, feature exploration.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Discovering patterns in car sales and blog post influence.
- **MapReduce & Spark:** Side-by-side demonstration of both paradigms.

## Requirements

In order to reproduce the project, one would have to run it on a machine that has both Hadoop HDFS and Spark set up, configured and running.
